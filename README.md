# Post Generator - Backend
by: Andres Ordonez

To run the server locally:

1. Clone the Repository
   First, navigate to the backend folder and clone the project repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Install Dependencies
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from nodejs.org.

Install the required npm packages by running:

```
npm install
```

3. Set Up Environment Variables
   Create a .env file in the root of your project directory if it doesn't already exist. Add your Gemini API key to this file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace your_api_key_here with your actual Gemini API key.

5. Run the Application
   Start the application using npm:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the server and you should see output indicating that the application is running.
